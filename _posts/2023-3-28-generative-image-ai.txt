title: Generative AI for Images
---

When I think of AI capabilities I tend to classify them in two. First, doing things that are impossible for humans. Second, doing things that humans can do but faster or cheaper.

An example of the first is asking Google Bard to search across a million papers and answer questions about them. An example of the second is image generation.

Using an image generation model is like having a team of photographers, graphic designers, and 3d artists on demand ready to create anything you can imagine. 

Image generation models are especially good at generating image types that are somehow present in their training set. If an artist anywhere in the world has ever thought of something, or if you have ever seen a work of art before - no matter how original you thought it was at that time - the models can probably recreate it. 

The variety of images that are being generated is astonishing. Here are some of my favorite prompts.

## Generation of characters

Here is Anya:

And here she is in a variety of action scenes. Keep in mind that even when using an image as part of the prompt the character may not look exactly the same.

We can also get multiple shots from different angles in the same image.

And we can change the seed while keeping the prompt. To see the effect of changing words or the word order. Keep in mind that even with the same seed and very similar prompts the images may vary substantially. The images below were all generated from the same seed changing only one word (the color of the hair).
