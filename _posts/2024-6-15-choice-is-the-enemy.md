title: Choice is the enemy

The bigger problem is not lack of options, but too many options. Lack of options pushes our ingenuity, drives us to work harder on whatever we can do. Too many options leads to paralysis and wasted effort. While we are looking for our path itâ€™s great to be able to explore many different options. But in the end, greatness will only come from focused concentrated effort. Options distract from that.
